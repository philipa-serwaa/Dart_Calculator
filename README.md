# Grade Calculator

A Dart program to calculate student grades based on continuous assessment, exam scores, and project scores.

## Opening in Android Studio

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to File -> Open
3. Navigate to and select this project folder
4. Wait for Android Studio to detect and set up the Dart project
5. Make sure the Dart SDK is properly configured in Android Studio:
   - Go to File -> Settings (or Android Studio -> Preferences on macOS)
   - Navigate to Languages & Frameworks -> Dart
   - Ensure the Dart SDK path is correctly set
6. Also make sure Dart SDK is properly added to system path. (Treat as very Important)
7. Flutter SDK will also work the magic. Install flutter and carefully configure it in Andriod Studio
   - This automatically configures Dart since dart packages are found in Flutter
